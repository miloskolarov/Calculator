# Calculator

## Introduction 

This project involved the creation of a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure of the calculator, including the screen and buttons, was styled using flex-box and grid in CSS. JavaScript functions were implemented to enable the calculator to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and the addition of decimal points. Additionally, the calculator features a backspace button (**âŒ«**) to remove previously typed numbers and a clear button (**C**) to reset all previous operations. The calculator is designed to operate with two numbers at a time and will recalculate the result of the previous two numbers if a new operator is introduced. To maintain visual consistency, displayed numbers are rounded to 11 decimals.
